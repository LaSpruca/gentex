# Gentex

**WIP**
This is a library for generating LaTeX code for various libraries such as Tikz. This crates will be expanded upon as I find time, or as I require more functionality. Currently documentation is very limited so good luck.

## Features

- `tikz`: Enable support for Tikz picture library
